üß∞ **Technologies Used**

| Layer                                   | Technologies                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend**                            | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript                              |
| **Styling**                             | Custom CSS (Gradient backgrounds, Flexbox/Grid, Transitions) |
| **Theme Control**                       | JavaScript + CSS (Class toggling for dark mode)              |
| **Responsive Design**                   | CSS Grid, Media Queries                                      |
| **Optional Extension** (if implemented) | Fetch API to load recipe data dynamically                    |



‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

1. **Initial Load**:

   * The app displays a default layout with a header, theme toggle, search bar, and recipe container.

2. **Theme Toggle**:

   * Clicking the toggle changes the `body` class (`dark`), which updates colors and gradients using CSS.

3. **User Search**:

   * When a user enters a keyword in the search bar and clicks "Search", the app can either:

     * Filter from preloaded data.
     * Or fetch data from a recipe API (like Edamam or TheMealDB) if implemented.

4. **Recipe Cards**:

   * Matching recipes are displayed in card format with:

     * Image
     * Title
     * Scrollable ingredients list
     * Instructions area

5. **Dynamic Styling**:

   * Cards and elements respond to hover, clicks, and scrolling with smooth transitions.


üß© **Use Case**

* **Everyday Users**: Find new recipes based on ingredients they already have.
* **Cooking Enthusiasts**: Explore international cuisines and step-by-step guidance.
* **UI/UX Showcase**: A great example for portfolios to demonstrate responsive layout and dynamic UI design.
* **Students/Learners**: A complete beginner-to-intermediate level project to understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS techniques.


üåç **Impact**

* Encourages **home cooking** by making recipes more accessible and searchable.
* Reduces food waste: users can search by available ingredients.
* Demonstrates modern **web development skills** such as theming, responsiveness, and modular layout.
* Can be enhanced further with **API integration, user authentication, saving favorite recipes**, or **voice-controlled search**, turning it into a scalable product.
